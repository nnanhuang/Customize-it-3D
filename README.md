<b>Pipeline.</b> We propose a two-stage framework Customize-It-3D for high-quality 3D creation from a reference image with subject-specific diffusion prior. We first cultivate subject-specific knowledge prior using multi-modal information to effectively constrain the coherency of 3D object with respect to a particular identity. At the coarse stage, we optimize a NeRF for reconstructing the geometry of the reference image in a shading-aware manner. We further build point clouds with enhanced texture from the coarse stage, and jointly optimize the texture of invisible points and a learnable deferred renderer to generate realistic and view-consistent textures.
